According to the Sheriff 's Department , at 5:40 a.m. , Billey Joe Johnson Jr. , a star running back and top recruit who 'd committed to Auburn University , shot himself in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun during a routine traffic stop . He allegedly attempted to break into an on-again , off-again girlfriend 's trailer , left the scene and run a traffic signal . Billey Joe then reportedly led deputy Joe Sullivan ( who did n't know about the alleged attempted break-in ) on a 1.5-mile chase before stopping , exiting the vehicle to give Sullivan his license , returning to his truck , and committing suicide . Many dispute these events—some people in town were reportedly upset that Billey Joe 's girlfriend was white , and resented his success . Sullivan 's is the only eyewitness account ( there was no dash cam footage ) .
